# First-Website-2024
My first website for the 1st semester in uni. It combines knowledge in html,css, javascript and a basic level of SQL and PHP backend.
This website is not completely functioning or well designed but it was developed based on strict details of the professor. It also contains a basic SQL Database for learning purposes as well as a API service that shows the weather in a location given by the user 

Weather API: https://openweathermap.org

Database hosted locally by: Xampp

To see the start of the project, in finalerg file open arxiki.html

To also view the rest of the project with no problems download Xampp Control Panel and start "Apache" and "MySQL module"
